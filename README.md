# The Evolution of the Binomial Theorem: From Euclid to Newton

## Overview
This project presents the development of the binomial theorem from Euclid's geometric approach to Newton's algebraic expansion. It was created for a Math 380 history math class and includes contributions from both Kevin Serafin and Lily Morales.
